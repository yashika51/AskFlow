# AskFlow

StackOverflow is now just one command away. Let AskFlow handle your errors!

AskFlow is a CLI tool built with an intention to access StackOverflow without leaving the (comfy!)terminal. It not only just access StackOverflow, it also scans your python script to find error automatically. 

That means no more searching error manually, let AskFlow ask for you. 

AskFlow is unique due its capability to search errors automatically in your script and returning most relevant answers. Unlike other CLI tools, we don't ask you to copy paste your errors. 

Leave the heavy lifting on us!

# Supported Platforms

As of now, AskFlow works smooth(as butter) on both **Windows** and **Linux**. Since Mac is selective, we are going to implement specific version for that in our future releases. 

# Installation and Usage

To get access to AskFlow, follow these steps:

1. Clone/Fork this repository
2. Navigate to the AskFlow folder from your terminal
3. Type `python cli.py search <path-to-your-script>` to scan your script for errors

AskFlow will detect errors and will return answers accordingly.

## Extra Features

To navigate between the answers

1. `next` to move on to the next answer. Type `python cli.py next` in your terminal.
2. `prev` to move on to the prev answer. Type `python cli.py previous` in your terminal.

# TL:DR; Specialities

- Automatic scanning for errors 
- Automatic searching for answers
- Next and Previous answer navigation
- Colored Interface

- Compatible with Windows and Linux

# What's next?

In future we plan to add features providing more options to the user including

and much more.
