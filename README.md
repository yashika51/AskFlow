# AskFlow

StackOverflow is now just one command away. Let AskFlow handle your errors!

AskFlow is a CLI tool built with an intention to access StackOverflow without leaving the (comfy!)terminal. It not only just access StackOverflow, it also scans your python script to find error automatically. 

That means no more searching error manually, let AskFlow ask for you. 

AskFlow is unique due its capability to search errors automatically in your script and returning most relevant answers. Unlike other CLI tools, we don't ask you to copy paste your errors. 

Leave the heavy lifting on us!
